        "Ubisoft has seemingly acknowledged recent leaks relating to Assassin's Creed 4: Black Flag Resynced, poking fun at the constant rumors surrounding the game. The gaming juggernaut has seen some major developments throughout recent weeks pertaining to some of the studio's biggest franchises. Ubisoft recently confirmed that the highly anticipated remake of Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time has officially been canceled, while leaks have hinted at upcoming reveals like Rayman 30th Anniversary Edition. However, Assassin's Creed Black Flag Resynced may be among the biggest rumored projects from Ubisoft.\n",
        "Assassin's Creed 4: Black Flag is often viewed by many as one of the best games in the long-running stealth-action franchise. The fourth main-series Assassin's Creed game has often been hailed for the depth of its in-game world, alongside the naval combat, which would become a fan favorite. Rumors have swirled throughout recent years about a potential remake in the works for Assassin's Creed 4: Black Flag, though a swath of delays and cancellations has now likely pushed the remake's release back even further into the future. Now, Ubisoft may have finally acknowledged the existence of the Assassin's Creed remake.\n",
        "A recent interaction from Ubisoft's official Twitter account may have confirmed the existence of Assassin's Creed Black Flag Resynced. The post comes as a reply to an image of a newly-leaked statue of Edward Kenway, which has surfaced online, simply responding with the iconic \"Here we go again\" screenshot from GTA: San Andreas. The post came as a surprise to fans, with Ubisoft not yet officially confirming that the Assassin's Creed remake is in production despite the litany of rumors surrounding the game. Ubisoft's internal schedule had suggested that Assassin's Creed Black Flag Resynced was set for a March release, though its timeframe is now unknown following the previously-mentioned delay.\n",
        "Ubisoft has kept its cards very close to its chest regarding Assassin's Creed Black Flag Resynced, with little information given. The studio's lack of an official reveal for the game has led many fans to start pushing for the developer to finally confirm Black Flag Resynced, with fans mentioning the game in many of the company's recent posts. Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot previously suggested that multiple Assassin's Creed remakes may be coming in the future, apart from the rumored Black Flag Resynced's debut. An Ubisoft insider even recently suggested that the company may be looking at rolling out 60 FPS upgrades for some of its older Assassin's Creed titles.\n",
        "Assassin's Creed Black Flag Resynced looks to join multiple new games on the way from the beloved franchise. Assassin's Creed Hexe is rumored to be launching sometime in 2026 as the next main-series game, said to focus on the 16th-century witch trials with a darker tone than typical Assassin's Creed games. Assassin's Creed: Jade is also in development as a mobile-oriented action RPG set in ancient China, though a release window has yet to be confirmed for the game.\n",
        "An official reveal for Assassin's Creed Black Flag Resynced could be a major step in the right direction after a rough few weeks for Ubisoft. The cancellation of the Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time remake saw significant backlash from fans, with multiple other games reportedly shelved alongside it. Recent claims have also suggested that another Ubisoft franchise may be done for good as well, with insiders claiming that the studio may be finished with the Watch Dogs series. Ubisoft officially acknowledging recent leaks surrounding Assassin's Creed Black Flag Resynced may be a good sign for the future of the remake, suggesting that a full reveal may not be so far off.\n",
